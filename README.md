# Guan

This project is called å…‰ (_Guan_), a Vulkan-based C++ rendering engine.

## Warnings

This system is still in its early status. Bugs may occur and sophisticated rendering techniques may not be
practical at the moment. Any pull requests are strongly **encouraged**! I hope everyone
can participate in the development of Guan.

## What is Guan?

I've been designing the engine to display advanced 3D graphics stably and swiftly.
Guan aims to employ features of GPUs while not losing the simplicity it pursues.

## How to build Guan?

The dependencies which Guan requires are listed as the followings:

1. VulkanSDK
2. One or more GPUs capable of running Vulkan-based softwares.

## Licensing Agreements

The application has been permitted to import
[Vulkan1.2.198.1_Windows](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/software/license/vulkan-1.2.198.1-windows-license-summary.txt)
and
[glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/copying.txt)
with regard to their licensing agreements.

## Additional Notices

Vulkan has been developed and maintained by the Kronos Group. The repository
utilizes Vulkan, but it **does not participate in Vulkan's development**.
